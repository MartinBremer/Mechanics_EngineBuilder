- create grid with with lettered rows and numbered columns for easy reference by players
- let players input names for P1 - P5 before each round (save names from last round)
- after purchase, cost doesn't matter, so don't display that in the hands, just the yields (split by tier), total resources, 
	and the number of resource cards of each tier

- layout:
	- compact player hands along the bottom
	- purchase selection above (with grid) probably horizontal with tier one being A1 to C3 and tier three being A6 - C6 (single column)
